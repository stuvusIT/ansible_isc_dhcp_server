| `isc_dhcp_server_hosts`               | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Dict of [host declarations](#host-declarations) so as to assign reserved addresses. |

### Host Declarations

In a host declaration, the key is a MAC address and the value is another dictionary containing the
keys `host` and `ip`.
Example:

```yaml
  "00:0a:95:9d:68:16":
    host: examplehostname
    ip: 192.168.10.16
```

The host with that MAC address will be statically assigned the given IP address.
The value of the `host` key is only used
[as per the isc-dhcp-server documentation](https://kb.isc.org/docs/isc-dhcp-41-manual-pages-dhcpdconf):

> The DHCP server determines the clientâ€™s hostname by first looking for a
> ddns-hostname configuration option, and using that if it is present. If no
> such option is present, the server looks for a valid hostname in the FQDN
> option sent by the client. If one is found, it is used; otherwise, if the
> client sent a host-name option, that is used. Otherwise, if there is a host
> declaration that applies to the client, the name from that declaration will be
> used. If none of these applies, the server will not have a hostname for the
> client, and will not be able to do a DNS update.

### Failover

DHCP failover allows to split the DHCP database between *exactly two hosts*.
Both hosts should have the same subnet as well the failover configs (excluding host-specific settings, of course).
I recommend reading the failover section in the [dhcpd.conf man page](https://linux.die.net/man/5/dhcpd.conf) before deploying this feature.
`isc_dhcp_server_failover` is a dict with the following options:

| Name                       | Required/Default                | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------|:-------------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `peer`                     | :heavy_check_mark:              | Hostname of the failover peer (if this is defined, failover is configured)                                                                               |
| `primary`                  | `False`                         | Whether this host is the primary one of both                                                                                                             |

| `port`                     | :heavy_check_mark:              | Port to use for both communication directions (the man page recommends `647` or `847`                                                                    |
| `peer_address`             | :heavy_check_mark:              | IP address of the peer for failover communication                                                                                                        |
| `max_response_delay`       | :heavy_check_mark:              | Number of BNDUPD messages sent before an ACK must be received (`10` seems to work for the man page authors)                                              |
| `split`                    | :heavy_multiplication_x:        | Ratio of how many IP addresses should be managed by the primary (Integer between `0` and `255`. The greater the value, the larger the primary ownership) |
| `mclt`                     | :heavy_check_mark: (on primary) | Maximum client lead time (time that one peer may renew a lease before contacting the other peer)                                                         |
| `load_balance_max_seconds` | :heavy_multiplication_x:        | Cutoff in seconds after which load balancing gets disabled                                                                                               |
| `max_lease_misbalance`     | :heavy_multiplication_x:        | Misbalance in percent of both address pools, after which balancing is started                                                                            |
| `max_lease_ownership`      | :heavy_multiplication_x:        | This value permits a small (percentage) skew in the lease balance of a percentage of the total number of free state leases.                              |
| `min_balance`              | :heavy_multiplication_x:        | Minimum age of leases to consider in rebalancing                                                                                                         |

### Subnets

`isc_dhcp_server_subnets` is a dict of subnets to configure.
You should configure every subnet that is attached to the DHCP server, but only set the range value for subnets you are authoritative for.
The key is the network address, the value of it is a dict with the following entries:

| Name                 | Required/Default         | Description                                                                                    |

| `range_begin`        | :heavy_multiplication_x: | First IP address to assign                                                                     |
| `range_end`          | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Last IP address to assign                                                                      |
